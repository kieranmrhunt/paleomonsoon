This compressed folder contains text files with the raw proxy values for all temperature records used in the article. Any values prior to c. AD 800 are truncated since they are not used in the study. The uppermost line in each file contains the following information from left to right: 1) longitude, 2) latitude, 3) abbreviation for type of proxy archive, 4) abbreviation for seasonality of signal, 5), original reference to the proxy records as cited in the Supplementary Material, and 6) name of the site/location. The second line in each file contains information about how the proxy record was obtained (see also the Supplementary Material), and, when appropriate, it is written within parenthesis if the values are inverted. From the third line onwards the left column contains the dates in year AD and the right column the proxy values.
