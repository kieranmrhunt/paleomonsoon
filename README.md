# PaleoCNN â€“ an explainable neural network for reconstructing paleoclimates

This code trains a bagged CNN ensemble on gridded rainfall and paleoclimate records. The trained CNN can then be used to reconstruct gridded rainfall over the full length of the paleoclimate records.

This code is set up to run on the Indian monsoon for 500 years, as described in our recent paper (https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/21/1/2025/).
